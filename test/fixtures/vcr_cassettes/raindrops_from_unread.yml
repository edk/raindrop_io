        NAS Storage Step by Step","excerpt":"What IS NAS Storage?  By enabling RTSP
        (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) on specific Indoor Cam/eufyCam series, the
        system will save all its recorded videos to your compatible NAS (Network-attached
        Storage).    The RTSP function only works with NAS that supports the RTSP
        protocol. In this FAQ, we will be using Synology NAS as an example.  This
        function is now available on the Android App and iOS App V1.7.5 or later.
           How Does It Work?  When the user is watching live or the camera detects
        the event and starts recording, the video will stream and save to the NAS.
        When the camera is in standby status, no video streams to the NAS. When you
        store your videos to NAS, the videos must be played back via the NAS application.
        eufy does not have permission to access to your data on NAS.     Up to two
        cameras can be added to your NAS for free. If you wish to add additional cameras
        you must pay the fee set by your NAS supplier.        What Should You Know?  If
        you choose for your camera to record “events” only, you may receive frequent
        notifications saying “Connection lost” or “Connection recovered” from NAS.
        This is because when an event occurs, eufyCam/Indoor Cam will initiate streaming
        via NAS. This is needed to connect to NAS.     How to make your NAS available
        on eufyCam/Indoor Cam?  1. Install Surveillance Station on the NAS  On your
        NAS, log into the NAS management page.Go to Package Center, search “surveillance
        station” and install.Once installed, the Surveillance Station can be found
        in the Main Menu.  Note: The software and package in different NAS may vary.    2.
        Enable RTSP on Indoor Cam/eufyCams  Go to eufy Security App - a specific camera
        that you want to stream to - Camera Settings - Storage - NAS(RTSP Stream).Enable
        NAS RTSP Stream.Write down the RTSP stream link for later use.    3. Add Indoor
        Cam/eufyCam to the NAS  Open the Surveillance Station.Find and click IP Camera
        on the left side.On the new window, go to Add -> Add Camera.    Select Quick
        Setup.       Name: give a name to this camera  Brand: choose User Define  Type:
        keep Streaming - RTSP  Path: input RTSP link indicated on the App.     Trigger
        the camera (you may walk or wave a hand in front of the camera), so that it
        wakes up and pushes the stream to NAS.Then it will pass the Test Connection.
        If it fails, please trigger the camera again and retry.    The captured videos
        can be found in Surveillance Station - Recording. You are now ready to use
        NAS.     You are now ready to use NAS!     FAQ  1. Which brand of NAS eufySecurity
        support?  The RTSP feature on eufyCam/Indoor Cam only works with the NAS which
        supports the RTSP protocol.Synology NAS is verified and compatible with the
        eufy Security. Other brands will need you to discover.      2. Why did the
        test fail?  Please make sure your NAS storage device and indoor camera/eufycam’s
        HomeBase are connected to the same Wi-Fi router.Please make sure the indoor
        camera/eufycam’s HomeBase has been set with a static IP address in your router.Please
        check if you have entered the correct parameters.Press the \"Retry\" button
        to try to setup the camera RTSP again.     3. Why don''t I have video clips
        after completing the test?  The video clips will be saved to your NAS only
        when motion is detected by the camera.When you test the connection in NAS,
        only the live feed will work. The motion detection function will be disabled
        during connection testing.It will take a few minutes for the system to upload
        clips to NAS. Please wait at least 5 minutes to check the clips in NAS after
        motion is detected.There will be some video clips missing due to when NAS
        lost connection.If your router IP address changes, the RTSP stream link will
        change as well. If this occurs, follow the RTSP setup guide to re-configure
        the parameters.     4. Why do I frequently have the message in the NAS that
        displays \"Connection recovered\" and \"Connection lost\"？  This is a normal
        occurrence. You can ignore these messages. \"Connection recovered\" means
        motion detection video clips will start to be saved to NAS. \" Connection
        lost\" means video clips have been saved to NAS.   If you have questions regarding
        how to set up NAS, please contact eufy customer support for further assistance.","note":"","type":"link","user":{"$ref":"users","$id":1629134},"cover":"https://rdl.ink/render/https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.eufy.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FUsing-NAS-Storage-Step-by-Step","media":[{"type":"image","link":"https://rdl.ink/render/https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.eufy.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FUsing-NAS-Storage-Step-by-Step","screenshot":true}],"tags":[],"removed":false,"created":"2023-06-09T00:16:07.000Z","lastUpdate":"2023-06-09T00:16:07.000Z","collection":{"$ref":"collections","$id":36370053,"oid":36370053},"highlights":[],"domain":"support.eufy.com","creatorRef":{"_id":1629134,"name":"user123","avatar":"","email":""},"sort":619049848,"collectionId":36370053}],"count":706,"collectionId":36370053}'
